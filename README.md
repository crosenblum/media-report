# 🎥 **media-report** 📊

## 📝 **Description**

This is a simple Python-based report tool designed to help you manage and analyze your media library! 📂  
Just provide paths to different parts of your library, and it will generate a basic report of:

- 📄 **.nfo files**
- 🎬 **Subtitles**
- 🖼️ **Images**

It’s basic for now, but more features will be added in the future! 🚀

Yes this script was generated by ChatGPT, because it was my idea, to provide small tools to enhance the maintenance, and analysis of media libraries.
